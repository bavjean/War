# A Game of War

This is a console "game" that does not require any user input, but will populate a deck of cards and then play against itself following the rules of the card game war. Each player will draw their top card to compare, and the higher card will take both. If both cards are equal, both players will put three cards face down and then compare another. This continues until one player has all of the cards.
